## 1. Average Spot Allocation per Bookable Schedule

### Trend Analysis
- **All Fitness**: 6.1 → 6.8 (Dec '24 → Nov '25) - **Upward trend ✓**
- **Long Tenure (>24mo)**: 7.0 → 7.2 - **Slight upward, relatively flat**
- **Short Tenure (≤24mo)**: 5.1 → 6.2 - **Strong upward trend ✓**

### Key Insights
- **Long tenure partners consistently allocate more spots** (7.0-7.3 range) than short tenure (5.1-6.2 range)
- **Short tenure shows stronger growth** (+1.1 spots) compared to long tenure (+0.2 spots)
- **The upward trend persists in both segments**, with short tenure showing more improvement

### Monthly Values
| Month | All Fitness | Long Tenure (>24mo) | Short Tenure (≤24mo) |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Dec '24 | 6.1 | 7.0 | 5.1 |
| Jan '25 | 6.1 | 7.0 | 5.3 |
| Feb '25 | 6.3 | 7.3 | 5.4 |

## 2. Disabled Schedules as % of Total Schedules

### Trend Analysis
- **All Fitness**: 12.2% → 9.4% (Dec '24 → Nov '25) - **Downward trend ✓**
- **Long Tenure (>24mo)**: 13.7% → 10.8% - **Downward trend ✓**
- **Short Tenure (≤24mo)**: 11.5% → 8.5% - **Downward trend ✓**

### Key Insights
- **Long tenure partners have higher disabled schedule rates** (10.8-13.7% range) than short tenure (8.5-11.5% range)
- **Both segments show improvement** (reduction in disabled schedules)
- **Short tenure shows better performance** (lower disabled rates) and stronger improvement

### Monthly Values
| Month | All Fitness % | Long Tenure (>24mo) % | Short Tenure (≤24mo) % |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Dec '24 | 12.2 | 13.7 | 11.5 |
| Jan '25 | 12.5 | 13.1 | 12.1 |

## 3. Soft Churn Rate

### Trend Analysis
- **All Fitness**: 1.0% → 0.9% (Dec '24 → Nov '25) - **Slight downward**
- **Long Tenure (>24mo)**: 0.7% → 0.5% - **Downward trend ✓**
- **Short Tenure (≤24mo)**: 1.2% → 1.2% - **Relatively flat, higher than long tenure**

### Key Insights
- **Long tenure partners have lower soft churn rates** (0.5-0.7% range) than short tenure (1.0-1.3% range)
- **Long tenure shows consistent improvement** (0.7% → 0.5%)
- **Short tenure rates are higher and more volatile** (1.0-1.3% range)

### Monthly Values
| Month | All Fitness % | Long Tenure (>24mo) % | Short Tenure (≤24mo) % |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Dec '24 | 1.0 | 0.7 | 1.2 |
| Jan '25 | 0.9 | 0.6 | 1.2 |
| Feb '25 | 0.9 | 0.6 | 1.1 |

## Overall Findings

### Spot Allocation
✅ **Upward trend persists in both tenure segments**
- Short tenure shows stronger growth (+1.1 spots)
- Long tenure maintains higher absolute values (7.0-7.3 range)

### Disabled Schedules
✅ **Downward trend (improvement) in both segments**
- Short tenure performs better (lower rates) and shows stronger improvement
- Long tenure starts higher but also improves

### Soft Churn
✅ **Long tenure performs better** (lower churn rates)
- Long tenure: 0.5-0.7% range
- Short tenure: 1.0-1.3% range (higher and more volatile)

## Conclusion

**Yes, the upward trend in average allocation per bookable schedule persists when segmented by tenure:**
- ✅ All Fitness: Upward trend
- ✅ Long Tenure (>24mo): Slight upward trend (maintains high values)
- ✅ Short Tenure (≤24mo): Strong upward trend (catching up)

The data shows that while long tenure partners allocate more spots on average, short tenure partners are improving faster and closing the gap.
